Plugins are extensions for your Minecraft server made by third-party developers.

They allow you to add new features and functionality to your server, such as custom join leave messages, anti-cheat systems, whole mini-games and much more.

In this guide we'll walk you through finding, installing, and configuring plugins.

### Finding Plugins
You can find plugins for your server by visiting one of the distribution platforms below.

[Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins) / [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/categories/spigot.4/) / [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io) / [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugins)

Make sure to check if your server is compatible with the plugin you want to install first, by running `version` in your servers console.

### Installing and updating plugins
<Steps>

    1. Download the `plugin.jar` file(s) that you want to install to your Minecraft server.

    2. Locate the `plugins` folder in your servers root file directory.
        <FileTree>

        - cache/
        - config/
        - logs/
        - **plugins/**
            - geese-mzing.jar plugin you uploaded
        - world/
        - world_nether/
        - world_the_end/

        </FileTree>
    3. Upload the `plugin.jar` file you downloaded to your servers `plugins` directory.

    4. Restart your Minecraft server, and you're done.

</Steps>

### Configuring Plugins

<Steps>

    1. Locate the `plugins` folder in your servers root file directory.
        <FileTree>

        - cache/
        - config/
        - logs/
        - **plugins/**
            - geese-mzing/ plugin specific directory
                - config.yml plugin specific configuration file
            - hello-world/ plugin specific directory
                - config.yml plugin specific configuration file
            - geese-mzing.jar plugin you uploaded
            - hello-world.jar plugin you uploaded
        - world/
        - world_nether/
        - world_the_end/

        </FileTree>

    2. Locate the corresponding plugin specific directory in your servers `plugins` directory to the plugin you installed on your server; based on the plugins name.

    3. Edit the contents of the `config.yml` file

    4. Restart your server, and you're done. Congrats.
